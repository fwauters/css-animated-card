# CSS-only animated card

You can access it [here](https://fwauters.github.io/css-animated-card/).

It's an exercise I did for my formation in BeCode. I didn't know what to do so I figure that a lovely picture whould be nicer to look at all day ^^

By the way, the picture is by Alice Alinari, I found it on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/lYrwjNl3AwM); and the exercise is [here](https://github.com/becodeorg/CRL-Woods-3.21/blob/master/LearningPath/01-Prairie/08.Animation-CSS/card.md).
